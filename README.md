# Neural Network in pure NumPy
### Create a football classification
A feedforward neural network from scratch without any high level libraries other than Numpy. Pure mathematics.

**It's a recreation of one of Deep Learning course assignment:**
- Refer to Football assignment from the first course of specialization.
- Rewritten from scratch by myself.
- Custom dataset generated in Processing. It's not randomized, you can place the dots as you wish.
- Before doing this I rewrote the code for Tensorflow Sequential API for Deep Learning Workshop during my Creative Coding class. That version is not available here.
